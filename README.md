# dsa-dynamic-array

A low-level Python implementation of a dynamic array built using `ctypes`.  
Mimics how arrays in C dynamically resize under the hood.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Manual memory allocation and resizing
- Understanding array capacity vs size
- Time complexity trade-offs of array operations

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Append, insert, and delete operations
- Automatic resizing when capacity is reached
- Manual implementation of a string library for practice
